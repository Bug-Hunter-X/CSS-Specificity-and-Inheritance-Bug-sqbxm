The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance.  The intention is to style all list items in the unordered list with a blue background. However, the styling is not applied as expected due to specificity issues. 

```css
ul {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

li {
  background-color: blue;
}

li.special {
  background-color: red;
}

```
