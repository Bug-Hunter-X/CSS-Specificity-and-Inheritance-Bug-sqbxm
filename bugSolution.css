The solution involves understanding and addressing the specificity conflict.  To ensure the `li` background-color takes precedence over the `ul` background-color, the specificity of the `li` selector should be increased. Here is the improved code:

```css
ul {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

li {
  background-color: blue !important; 
}

li.special {
  background-color: red;
}

```

By adding `!important` to the `li` declaration, it overrides the `ul` rule.  This ensures the blue background-color is applied consistently.
